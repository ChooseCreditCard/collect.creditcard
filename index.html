    <!-- What is “collection” in card terms? -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What does “collection” mean for credit cards?</h2>
      <p class="small">
        In card payments, “collection” is everything that happens when the bank tries to get the money back
        after you spend: regular monthly payments, minimum amounts, interest, and – if payments stop –
        reminders, late fees and debt-collection processes.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Billing</strong> – generating your monthly statement and calculating what you owe.</li>
        <li><strong>Repayment</strong> – collecting at least the minimum due by the due date.</li>
        <li><strong>Delinquency</strong> – when payments are late or missed for a period of time.</li>
        <li><strong>Collections</strong> – structured efforts to recover overdue debt, often via specialist teams or agencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Charge-off</strong> – when a bank moves long-overdue debt off its active books (but you can still owe it).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Understanding the collection side of cards is key to avoiding unnecessary fees, protecting your
        credit profile and staying in control if life events disrupt your income.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How card billing & collections work step by step</h2>
      <p class="small">
        While details vary by issuer and country, most card billing and collection flows look roughly like this:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>1. Statement period closes</strong> – all transactions in the cycle are summed, plus fees and interest.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Statement is issued</strong> – you receive a statement with:
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Statement balance</li>
            <li>Minimum payment due</li>
            <li>Payment due date</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>3. Grace period</strong> – if you pay the full balance by the due date, you often avoid interest on new purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Minimum payment</strong> – paying only the minimum avoids immediate default, but keeps you in debt longer
          and generates interest.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Late or missed payment</strong> – triggers late fees, possible penalty interest and negative credit reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Early-stage collections</strong> – reminders via SMS, email, app, calls; offers to set up payment plans.</li>
        <li><strong>7. Advanced collections</strong> – after repeated non-payment, accounts can move to internal or external
          collection teams.</li>
        <li><strong>8. Charge-off &amp; legal actions</strong> – in long-term non-payment, debt may be written off, sold or pursued legally.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Many problems can be softened or avoided by contacting the issuer early, before an account moves
        deeper into the collection pipeline.

    <!-- Types / models -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common collection & repayment models</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Card products can handle collection and repayment in different ways. Some models are more flexible
        and user-friendly than others:
      </p>

      <div class="cluster-grid">
        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Standard revolving credit</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Classic credit-card model: you can carry a balance, pay a minimum each month and pay interest on
            the remaining amount. Flexible but risky if balances keep growing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Charge cards &amp; pay-in-full</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Requires full payment each month, with no option to revolve. Less interest risk, but strict
            collection if payments are missed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Autopay &amp; smart repayment tools</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Automatic collection of at least the minimum – or full balance – from a bank account. Reduces
            late payments but requires careful cash-flow planning.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Installment &amp; “buy now, pay later” plans</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Some cards let you convert purchases or balances into fixed installments with a clear end date.
            Helpful if fees and rates are transparent and reasonable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Hardship &amp; relief programs</h3>
          <p class="small">
            In cases of job loss, illness or crisis, issuers may offer temporary reduced payments, paused
            interest or structured repayment plans.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>External debt collection &amp; sale</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Long-overdue accounts may be transferred or sold to external collection agencies, adding new
            dynamics, contacts and sometimes extra costs.
