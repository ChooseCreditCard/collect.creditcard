    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does It Mean to “Collect” With a Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>
        When people talk about “collecting points” with a card, they usually mean earning a loyalty currency – airline
        miles, hotel points or flexible bank points – on top of the underlying payment. The card becomes a bridge between
        everyday spend and long-term rewards like flights, nights or upgrades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmes differ in how they credit points, which currencies they use and how valuable those points are in real
        use. Collecting is less about chasing the biggest number and more about matching earning to a programme you
        actually plan to redeem with.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Points & Miles Are Collected on Card Spend</h2>
      <p>
        Each transaction you make is tagged with a merchant category and amount. The card’s reward engine uses this to
        decide how many points to add to your balance – for example, 3x on travel, 2x on dining and 1x on everything
        else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Co-branded cards usually send points directly into a partner programme (an airline or hotel), while bank rewards
        cards keep points in a bank currency that can later be transferred or redeemed in multiple ways. Both models can
        suit collectors, but they behave differently when programmes change or travel plans shift.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Strategies -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Basic Strategies for Collecting More Effectively</h2>
      <p>
        Collecting more is not only about spending more. Three common strategies are:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>• <strong>Align spend with multipliers:</strong> use the right card for categories with higher earning rates.</li>
        <li>• <strong>Concentrate on a few ecosystems:</strong> avoid scattering points across many minor balances.</li>
        <li>• <strong>Combine travel and everyday spend:</strong> pair flight or hotel activity with card earning.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Going beyond this often means monitoring limited-time bonuses, partner offers and seasonal promotions – useful,
        but only if they fit into travel plans you would make anyway.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risks & limits -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Limits, Expiry and When Collecting Backfires</h2>
      <p>
        Points and miles are not savings accounts. Programmes may devalue charts, raise redemption rates or add new
        surcharges over time. Some currencies expire if there is no activity within a set period, which can quietly erode
        balances for low-frequency collectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collecting purely for the sake of collecting – spending more than needed just to hit a bonus – can quickly offset
        any notional gain. A useful test is whether you would still be comfortable with the purchase if no points were
        awarded at all.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Credit & issuer perspective -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How Issuers and Programmes View Heavy Collectors</h2>
      <p>
        From the issuer side, active collectors can be attractive if they pay on time and use the card across a wide
        range of merchants. For loyalty programmes, card-based earning deepens engagement and often represents a major
        revenue stream.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, both issuer and programme track behaviour: patterns of manufactured spend, unusual refund
        activity or attempts to cycle limits may breach terms and lead to restrictions or account actions.
