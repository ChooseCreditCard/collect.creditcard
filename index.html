    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does It Mean to “Collect” Card Points?</h2>
      <p>
        Collecting points or miles with a credit card means that your everyday purchases generate a separate currency:
        points in a bank program or miles in an airline or hotel loyalty scheme. Over time, this balance can be swapped
        for flights, hotel stays, statement credits or other rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
        A healthy collecting strategy focuses on <strong>spending you would make anyway</strong>. The goal is to route normal
        expenses through the right card, not to invent extra purchases just to see the points counter go up.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How to collect -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>Core Ways to Collect Points & Miles</h2>
      <p>
        Most collectors focus on a small set of cards that match their spending pattern. Typical building blocks include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-100/90">
        <li><strong>Base card for everyday spend:</strong> a reliable earn rate on all purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus-category cards:</strong> higher earn on travel, dining, groceries or online shopping.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-branded loyalty cards:</strong> tied to a specific airline or hotel program.</li>
        <li><strong>Welcome bonuses:</strong> large one-time boosts when you meet a minimum spend (without overspending).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A simple starting point is to pick <strong>one main rewards card</strong> and learn its categories well. As you get more
        comfortable, you can add a second card if it clearly improves your earn rate on a big spending category such as travel or groceries.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Tracking & value -->
    <section id="tracking" class="section">
      <h2>Tracking Your Points and Their Real Value</h2>
      <p>
        Collecting is only useful if you can see what your points are worth. Simple habits:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-100/90">
        <li>Keep a basic list of your active programs and point balances.</li>
        <li>Note roughly what a typical redemption costs (points + cash fees).</li>
        <li>Estimate a <strong>rough value per point</strong> for your most common redemptions.</li>
        <li>Watch for expiry dates or “activity required” rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you notice that a program is hard to use, has frequent devaluations or pushes redemptions you do not want, it may be better to slow down collecting there and switch to simpler cashback or a different points ecosystem.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risks & when to slow down -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When Collecting Points Stops Making Sense</h2>
      <p>
        It is easy to cross the line from smart collecting into chasing points. Red flags include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-100/90">
        <li>Carrying a balance and paying interest just to earn points.</li>
        <li>Keeping many overlapping cards with annual fees you do not justify.</li>
        <li>Holding very large point balances but rarely redeeming.</li>
        <li>Letting the points program, not your real needs, dictate where and when you travel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many cases, a straightforward low-fee card plus one solid rewards card is enough. The best “collection” is the one that fits your life, not a leaderboard screenshot.
